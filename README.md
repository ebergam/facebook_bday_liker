# Facebook Birthday wishes liker
## A (not yet working) python script to automatically like birthday posts on your Facebook.

This script works with python's Selenium. You should use the URL where all the birthday wishes posts are together. 
The script will scroll down clicking on the 'load more' div and, when I'll understand how to make it work (help is welcome!) click on the like butto for each post.

It works on XPATH, so it may require some tuning before use.

*After the use heartfully comment every post, showing that you aren't a soulless coder.*
